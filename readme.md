## Halted Project

I lost motivation to work on this for now. The code is here if you want to take a look.

## Purpose

Being able to see your live chat while simulcasting to multiple live streaming platforms as well as seeing live chat's while a stream is scheduled but not happening yet (YouTube) and also the messages people leave on your Twitch channel while you are not there (since they only show form the time you go to the site).

Additionally, adding functionality like forwarding messages between platforms and highlighting comments in your stream as a lower third and such.

## Todo List

Lot's of things. Currently managed in private Dynalist todo list.

## Future Ideas

Coming…
