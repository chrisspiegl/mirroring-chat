# Changelog

## 2020-05-26 15:20

- Backend: Twitch: completely rewrite twitch irc bot with all kinds of event listening (things that twitch is sending, as well as events like `CHAT_CREATED` and `CHAT_UPDATED` so that we can join and leave a chat and such things based on that information)
- Backend: minor cleanup of filenames and stuff
- Backend: Twitch: testing how I could implement a interval based queue to be used to not run into rate limiting with the twitch IRC server (aka 20 commands per 30 seconds) found p-queue which can do this relatively easily and with a simple implementation. Stored in TwitchListener for later.
- Backend: Twitch: Listening for `CHAT_CREATED`, `CHAT_UPDATED`, and `CHAT_DELETED` to `join`, `part&join`, and `part` the channel that is being updated.

## 2020-05-25 15:43

- Frontend: Adding vuescroll for a smoother and more beautiful scrollbar implementation.
- Frontend: Update to use fontawesome for brand icons and all others as well.
- Frontend: Disable special warning for fontawesome stuff.
- Backend: Update messagesStore to return the correct sort order and limitations of chat messages (no pagination at this time)
- Backend: Make messagesStore subscribe and unsubscribe unique id based so that it's easy to unsubscribe from events again via a given id. This makes it possible to have a telegram chat or a socket.io socket uniquely being subscribed just once. This also makes it possible that two chat windows can be open in separate browsers and both receive the same notifications (before one would always disconnect because the second would get the message 'already connected')
- Frontend: Update the chat windows with a manual way of keeping the scroll at the bottom while using vuescroll as a beautiful scroll bar.
- Frontend: Additionally implemented a new card layout with images, and headlines, and icons for the different providers, and time being displayed based on the time that has passed since the message was received.
- Frontend: make project version exposed in vuex store to be displayed to users.
- Frontend: add home page text with project description and a FAQ section.
- Frontend/Backend: made sure that the socket.io settings are set to infinitely try to reconnect on connection loss so that the streaming chat's and stuff are going to automatically continue even when the server restarts.

## 2020-05-24 15:23

- Backend: Implement RedisKeyGenerator so that all redis keys are generated in a central location and can easily be updated in the future.
- Backend: Database based store for all Chat Messages implemented (updated Twitch and YouTube Crawler as well as Socket.io and Telegram Notification sending)
- Backend: Put Redis Subscribe code into message store for easier notification listening on new messages
- Backend: Make YouTube Crawler database based and automatically disable / enable crawling based on database settings for channels
- Backend: Make channels/broadcasts separate in the mysql database
- Backend: YouTube: Make Broadcast Search and new Chat Messages Crawl via Cron Job
- Backend: Implemented a Redis Pub Sub Manager to have all those notifications go through one central class. This way we do not have multiple listeners and do not have to be careful to close any listeners while others are still listening. While doing so, I also (for now) decided to not 'minimize' the messages when sending through redisâ€¦ over optimizing in early stages is only a source for errors.
- Backend: added a global event stack which goes through the RedisPubSubManager and thus is available to all instances that may be listening to these events. Events include but are not limited to USER_LOGIN, USER_CREATED, CHAT_CREATED, CHAT_UPDATED, CHAT_MESSAGE_RECEIVED, and more. This gives the possibility to react to things across processes and applications (even across multiple servers if need be). These events do not guarantee delivery! THat's what RSMQ is for. But these events make it possible for me to have settings for a twitch channel be updated on the web-interface, and the twitch bot process can then update itself accordingly.

## 2020-05-19 08:57

- Backend: Database - make 'strict mode' compatible again.
- Backend: Database - cleanup all eslint warnings and errors
- Gulpfile: cleanup of gulpfile with eslintrc fixes and some minor cleanup
- Backend/Frontend: Telegram - Add telegram link functionality and streaming ability to make chat messages available on mobile devices through telegram bot.
- Backend/Frontend: Telegram - Also already implemented functionality to limit the bot to only be used in private chats or by admins (use as needed on a per command level bases)
- General code cleaning in some respects.

## 2020-05-18 19:23

- Backend: YouTube Chat Listener - Implemented bot to automatically auth with youtube api based on oAuth2 login details.
- Backend: YouTube Chat Listener - Implemented function to check which streams are `upcoming` and `active` for a specified user.
- Backend: YouTube Chat Listener - Implemented function to watch a stream for new messages and to do so on an interval (this however comes with the problem that the api cost of polling needs to be considered ðŸ˜•).
- Backend: YouTube Chat Listener - Implemented a redis key to remember the broadcast nextPage variable which makes sure that a specific broadcasts messages are not crawled multiple times into the chat redis (this may change in the future to a database based system to store the chat messages and not just put them into redis)?
- Backend: YouTube Chat Listener - opted for a once per minute check for now to reduce the API Quota needs and reduce the risk of running into those limits while testing already.
- Backend/Frontend: made sure the chat messages are associated to the `idUser` instead of the twitch `channelName` in redis storage and socket communication.
- Backend: MessageStore to store the original provider message object additionally to a cleaned version so that the frontend can show those details eventually (verified badge, moderator, and more).
- Code Formatting

## 2020-05-18 08:57

- Backend: replace self made middleware for async route functions in express.js with a public npm package called `const asyncHandler = require('express-async-handler')`. In the future I may move to `fastify` or a different server implementation but for now I am sticking with `express.js` because I know it.
- Backend: Socket.io cleanup. `Express Status Monitor` had to be changed because it was hijacking my socket.io connection, now it uses the same socket.io connection as the rest of the backend.
- Backend: Socket.io chat messages are being sent again and working.

## 2020-05-18 00:50

- Frontend: vue.js added a component functionality to scroll the chat to the bottom automatically if it's already at the bottom.
- Tried to fix the socket.io connection, but I can't figure out for some reason. It just is not working :( will have to get back to that with a clear mind.

## 2020-05-17 17:28

- Frontend: vue.js implemented Json Web Token based authentication flow (user is redirected to callback based server authentication oauth flow based on provider chosen, then the backend redirects to `/login/success` which calls the api `/api/v1/auth/token` to retrieve the jwt token for the session) (Note: this can be improved with a frontend only flow but right now, this works and will be used for the time being. Eventually there will be a solution without session cookies)
- Frontend: vue.js updated 'link & unlink' functionality to work with the new frontend implementation
- Frontend: vue.js updated chat to use twitch username of logged in user as channel name (needs improving in the future to be a `idUser` based chat instead)
- Frontend: vue.js started to use pug for templating (much easier to write and read in my opinion)
- Backend: Passport.js refresh was broken because of missing `require('./passport)` so that the used strategies are available.

## 2020-05-12 18:58

- Frontend: vue.js build system (understanding, learning, setup, trial and error)
- Frontend: vue.js integrate moment date filter
- Frontend: vue.js integrate socket.io (had to downgrade to earlier version of vue-socket.io because of a bug)
- Frontend: vue.js show chat messages (load via API call)
- Backend: API: implement api file structure and `/api/v1/chat/messages/:channel` as first route
- Backend: make `redisSubscriber` one reusable client connection just like `redisClient`
- Backend: message store to provide encode and decode methods for smaller redis storage while staying readable in code
- Backend: Twitch Crawler: added configuration setting for twitch bot username
- Backend: Twitch Crawler: twitch bot automatically listens to all active users on the platform (will change in the future)
- Backend/Frontend: made redis keys a bit cleaner, never use twitch channel name with `#` in the beginning (just confusing), and update all the pub/sub to work together again
- Backend/Frontend: Socket: implement disconnect to close down redis.subscribe for certain channel once view left or socket disconnected
